### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Vladimir, a Full Stack Engineer with a passion for software development and data processing automation. My expertise lies in JavaScript/TypeScript, Node.js, Python, and C programming. At the moment, I specialize in building and maintaining web applications using frameworks like Angular, NestJS, and Express.js. Find more information about my skills and experience in my [Curriculum Vitae](https://enginerd.io/cv/).

In my spare time, I delve into web services integration using tools like Node-RED, solve Advent of Code puzzles using the C programming language, engage in bot development for the Telegram platform, and explore other activities related to automation just for fun. When I'm not immersed in the tech world, I enjoy hiking and playing video games, particularly colony simulators like RimWorld and Space Haven.
